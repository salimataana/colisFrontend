# Organization of work

The project was entirely carried out by me.
I used Vue.js for frontend development, 
with a structure organized into components.
I also used Vue Router for navigation. 
The project was completed with Axios for API requests, 
and I integrated CSS and HTML for styling and structure.

# Technologies used

Vue.js: For creating an interactive and dynamic user interface.
Axios: For API calls and asynchronous data management.
HTML/CSS: For the structure and style of the application.
JavaScript: For functional logic.

# What worked well

Managing vue.js components.
Management of different routes.
footer works well.
navbar works well.
Frontend login works well.
Frontend register works well.
Frontend List of Packet works well.
Frontend PacketTracking works well.
Frontend Home works well.

Frontend Packet works well.


# Difficulties encountered

Handling asynchronous API errors required additional adjustments.

# What I learned

Using components with vue.js
API integration with axios for communication between backend and frontend.

# Possible improvements

Integrate unit tests to ensure code robustness.
Further structure error handling and user notifications.

# Items to absolutely keep

Using Axios for API communications.
The clear and fluid organization of the code.
