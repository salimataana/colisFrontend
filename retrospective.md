# Organization of work

The project was entirely carried out by me.
I used Vue.js for frontend development, 
with a structure organized into components.
I also used Vue Router for navigation. 
The project was completed with Axios for API requests, 
and I integrated CSS and HTML for styling and structure.

# Technologies used

Vue.js: For creating an interactive and dynamic user interface.
Axios: For API calls and asynchronous data management.
HTML/CSS: For the structure and style of the application.
JavaScript: For functional logic.

# What worked well

Managing vue js components
Management of different routes

# Difficulties encountered

Handling asynchronous API errors required additional adjustments.

# What I learned

Using components with vue.js
API integration with axios for communication between backend and frontend

# Possible improvements

Integrate unit tests to ensure code robustness.
Further structure error handling and user notifications.

# Items to absolutely keep

Using Axios for API communications.
The clear and fluid organization of the code.
