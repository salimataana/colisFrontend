This template should help get you started developing with Vue 3 in Vite.

## Recommended IDE Setup

I used **WebStorm** as the Integrated Development Environment (IDE) for this project.
WebStorm offers excellent support for Vue.js, 
including features like code completion, 
real-time error detection, and built-in Git integration.
