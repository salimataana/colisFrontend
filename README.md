This template should help get you started developing with Vue 3 in Vite.
## Description

This project is a frontend application developed with Vue.js,
intended to manage and track parcel deliveries in real time.
It allows users to interact with a parcel management system 
via a user-friendly and efficient interface.

## Recommended IDE Setup

I used **WebStorm** as the Integrated Development Environment (IDE) for this project.
WebStorm offers excellent support for Vue.js, 
including features like code completion, 
real-time error detection, and built-in Git integration.
